# D-MARK

### Open Hardware for Your ARM! (OHYA!)

D-MARK is a ready-to-run open development board based on an unbeatable price-to-performance STM32F070RB ARM microcontroller.
In contrast to already existing evaluation boards and development kits in the market, D-MARK focuses on real-life applications
with carefully selected types and numbers of inputs and outputs to save re-investment hardware cost of developers.

D-MARK comes with the open-source D-MARK Script Interpreter firmware (DMSI) which means no coding experience is necessary to run various simple controlling and data aquisition tasks.

Developers can use D-MARK in the following ways:

- As a real-life starter board for learning ARM microcontroller
- Make a controller boards right out the box using on-board sensor inputs or extend their own through the SenseLog ports
- Make a motion cotrol application using on-board stepper and servo controller
- With the built-in DMSI scripting language, users can make the board run without programming if they don't want to 
- Best for teaching in a class as it can either be the first experimental board or the final application hardware
- Deploy it as a stand-alone or as a part of their final products
